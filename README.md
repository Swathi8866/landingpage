# landingpage
A landing page is known as the lead capture page, static page, or destination page which is designed for a specific task and appears because of an online advertisement or a search engine optimization result. When the user arrives on a landing page it is free from all distractions like the home page and mainly aims to capture a visitor’s information through that form and make them feel comfortable that the website has the solution to their problems. It is a special web page that mainly helps to drive traffic for a marketing campaign.

A landing page must have a “call-to-action” with a specific goal in mind. A successful landing page is one that has higher conversion rates, increased engagement, and better quality leads.
Approach to creating a Landing Page:

Create the basic layout of the landing page using HTML that includes a basic nav bar, a basic homepage a body section, and a signup page.
Style the layout created by HTML using CSS and link the CSS file to the HTML file.
Create an index.js file and write the javascript code to display the nav bar in a sliding menu when the website is viewed on small screens
